# Franklin Mburu Kamande

**Full-Stack Engineer (Backend-Focused)** — Engineering Secure Backend Systems | AI-Powered Execution & Decision Infrastructure | Secure Multi-Tenant Architecture

Nairobi, Kenya

## What I Build

- **Secure Backend Systems**: Django/FastAPI applications with JWT authentication, RBAC, audit logging, and transactional integrity patterns
- **Enterprise Architecture**: Multi-tenant systems with tenant isolation strategies, normalized schemas, structured logging, and performance-conscious design
- **AI Execution Infrastructure**: Modular pipelines combining LangChain, vector memory (ChromaDB), and deterministic validation layers for controlled, auditable AI-powered decisions
- **Database Systems**: PostgreSQL and MySQL design for consistency, indexing strategies, and complex query optimization

---

## Core Stack

**Backend & API**
- Python: Django, Django REST Framework, FastAPI, Flask
- PostgreSQL, MySQL

**Security & Infrastructure**
- Authentication: JWT, session management
- Authorization: RBAC, permission decorators, policy-based access control
- Enterprise Patterns: audit logging, structured logging, transactional workflows

**AI & Memory**
- LangChain, ChromaDB
- RAG pipelines, vector memory systems
- Guardrails and deterministic validation

**Frontend**
- React, TypeScript
- Vue/Vuetify (as needed)
